# README #

This is a collection of ROS packages maintained by Maeve Automation for
research and development purposes. Each package contains its own README with
details about its contents.

All packages are released under open source licenses, however, not all code is
under the same license.

## Releases ##

Each release of the codebase is tagged with `release-X` where 'X' is the
release number. Releases represent functionality that is in some sense complete
and tested.

Revisions of the codebase between releases may include new functionality and
fixes but may also include incomplete or broken code, so caveat emptor.

## Collaboration and the Ubuntu Mate Platform ##

Users of the Maeve Automation Ubuntu Mate platform for Raspberry Pi get team
member access to this repository. That means they can create and push branches
so long as the branch name matches the pattern `feature-request-*`. After
review, branches are merged onto default. Collaboration is encouraged.
