# README #

This is a collection of ROS packages maintained by Maeve Automation for
research and development purposes. Each package contains its own README with
details about its contents.

All packages are released under open source licenses, however, not all code is
under the same license.

## Releases ##

Each release of the codebase is tagged with `release-X` where 'X' is the
release number. Releases represent functionality that is in some sense complete
and tested.

Revisions of the codebase between releases may include new functionality and
fixes but may also include incomplete or broken code, so caveat emptor.

## Collaboration and the Ubuntu Mate Platform ##

Collaboration is welcome and encouraged :-).

Anyone with a Bitbucket account may contribute, but users of the Maeve
Automation Ubuntu Mate platform for Raspberry Pi get built-in team member
access to this repository under the "maeve-pi" user. That means they can
immediately create and push feature branches. After review, branches are merged
onto default.
