# README #

This is a collection of ROS packages maintained by Maeve Automation for
research and development purposes. Each package contains its own README with
details about its contents.

All packages are released under open source licenses, however, not all code is
under the same license.

## Releases ##

Each release of the codebase is tagged with `release-X` where 'X' is the
release number. Releases represent functionality that is in some sense complete
and tested.

Revisions of the codebase between releases may include new functionality and
fixes but may also include incomplete or broken code, so caveat emptor.
