# README #

This package contains simple geometry library functionality that is not readily
available elsewhere. Included in this package are data structures and algorithms
for representating and operating on:

* Real number intervals
* Disjoint interval sets
* Axis-aligned Bounding Boxes

In addition, methods for approximate comparisons with an absolute epsilon are
included. See the unit tests for usage.
