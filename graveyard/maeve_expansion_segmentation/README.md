Estimate up to N objects based on spatiotemporal edge detection. This actually works fairly well, but it depends heavily on parameters being adjusted for a given scene. Probably a classifier could be learned to initialize parameters online and then they could be further tuned during optimization.

Because making this package useful requires significant investment in machine learning and vision work, it is being retired to the graveyard. At some point it may be resurrected if resources become available.
